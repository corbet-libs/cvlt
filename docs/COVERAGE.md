# Coverage contract

CI measures production Rust lines and branches with cargo-llvm-cov and requires
100% of both. A zero-count report fails. Test harness files are excluded from the
production denominator. Browser
vectors execute in headless Chrome; a compile check is not execution evidence.
Native coverage does not establish coverage of wasm-only adapters.

Stable Rust runs product validation. Nightly is used only for upstream Rust's
experimental branch instrumentation. CI resolves dependencies once and uploads
Cargo.lock; all jobs consume that exact snapshot with --locked. Weekly CI refreshes
the snapshot and Dependabot proposes manifest/lock updates. A failed coverage gate
is an open requirement, never evidence of complete coverage.

Actual browser Rust coverage runs the same owner vectors through wasm-bindgen
minicov on current nightly. Upstream instrumentation failures remain red and
are reported separately from stable browser execution.
Stable Rust separately builds and executes the product vectors. Native and wasm
line/branch gates are independent; neither substitutes for the other. LCOV
merges generic instantiations at the source-line boundary and preserves every
measured branch. The JSON report remains available as diagnostic evidence.
